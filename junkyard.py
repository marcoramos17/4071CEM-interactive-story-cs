intro = """=======================POST-APOCALYPTIC JUNKYARD=======================
What happens when you’re run out of your job for being inefficient, despite being the hardest working employee you know? 
What happens when afterwards you go out to find another job, but suddenly everything seems so cut off? Every company that
you email sends back an automated reply, your calls are answered by speech bots, and every job centre you know of is
suddenly closed.  
This is my reality now. Our reality; mine and that of every other person living in this city. Over the course of months,
every large corporation and business secretly ran their workers out of their careers. An incredible number of people
and families were affected by their sudden total loss of income, with many turning to crime or sex work to get paid.  
When every low-level employee was sacked, the corporations brought in their machines. Androids, supercomputers, all 
sorts of artificial intelligence and robotic machinery had replaced – no, uprooted the job market. They operated at speeds
and efficiencies that no human could ever hope to replicate. They didn’t need to be paid wages, only occasional maintenance
fees. They were better than human workers in every single way, hence there was no use for us, they named them “Golems”. 
Governments and corporations started to see impossibly large profit margins while the public were left to suffer. With 
the lack of income combined with rising food prices and energy bills, we were forgotten about by those who were meant to
care for us. The rich got richer, while the sick got sicker. It was an apocalypse, destroying the lives of millions. 
We needed a new home, a new everything. And we found it. We created it. This is the Junkyard, an entirely new civilisation
made by the common people for the common people. The Junkyard heavily reduced living taxes for all and did their best to
ensure that all people had their basic needs met, but without large funding they struggled to provide. The Junkyard was
keeping under the radar, away from the eyes of the corporate, knowing they would act if they knew that the Junkyard was 
not being capitalised.  
My name is Elon West, and I’m a nobody, just as everybody else is a nobody. I live in a single-floor house in the Junkyard
and pay the rent by scavenging for materials. It’s hardly the career I used to have, but it’s a job and it pays. I go 
beyond the borders of the Junkyard and search for any usable resources: scrap, supplies, anything that someone could use 
back in the Junkyard. We’re a community: everyone knows everyone. We try to be welcoming to outsiders, but with the 
looming threat of the corporate attempting to infiltrate us, we need to be careful. 
I know quite a few people here, I see plenty of friends at bars and clubs in the nights, but there is a small circle of 
people that I can truly confide in. The first is Tai, a mechanic and an absolute car nut that definitely has mental 
problems. If you need a ride fixed up, he’s the man to go to, if you need muscle in a certain job, he is the man to go. 
Often during the day he’s off-roading, kicking up dirt and mud miles away from here. At nights he often just shuts himself 
away in his garage, working on God knows what.  
There’s also Beth, the silver tongue of the group. Often, you’ll find her nicking some items from a store or generally 
causing some minor havoc, yet she somehow always manages to talk her way out of trouble. Her natural charisma makes her 
a great friend, and a terrifying enemy. The last person I know very well is Akima, a woman who knows a lot more about 
computers than anyone else I know. She’s young, but a computer scientist with a degree in ethical hacking, though from 
what I know the hacking she does nowadays is far from ethical. She’s gotten herself into camera feeds, bank accounts, 
anywhere else that she shouldn’t be. Akima could have had a life living in the corporate world, but she once got too big 
for her boots and attempted to hack into a major bank branch, immediately painting a target on her head. She takes refuge
here now. 
All four of us share a vision beyond the Junkyard. We want a society where we don’t have to work as much as we once did, 
but still had the means to live comfortably. The employment market previously was corrupt, but it was better than not 
having a market at all. Akima suggested we abandon any disregard for the law and get money illicitly, essentially stealing 
from the corporate. Initially I didn’t know how I felt about that, but both Tai and Beth were heavily onboard with the 
idea, so I was too. 
They suggested that I speak with Kane, so that’s where I’m headed now. Kane is an officer who used to be on the side of 
the corporate, but for some reason she defected and secretly joined us, acting as our spy. She never explained to anyone 
why she betrayed them, and frankly I’m too afraid to ask. Nowadays Kane spends her days making sure that supplies 
mysteriously disappear from corporate warehouses and end up in the Junkyard. I don’t know how she does it so consistently
without being caught. 
Somehow, Kane spots me before I spot her. I feel a hand grab my shoulder from behind and her somewhat gravelly voice speak,
“Hey there, West. Haven’t seen you in a while.” I nod and turn around. She’s wearing her usual boring plain clothes, and
her usual smirk on her face. “Hey, Kane. I was looking for you, actually.” Kane tilts her head in curiosity, and I explain 
what my crew and I wanted to do. “You want to hit the corporate right where it hurts? Well, I don’t usually condone crime
but it seems you’ve got a solid crew behind you. A driver, a hacker, a sweet talker. I can think of two things you could do.
Either you could hit one of their banks and strike a blow against their economic security, or you could try targeting an
important person. Kidnapping, assassination, depends what you’re willing to do and for how much. 
I blink in surprise. “That sounds a little... extreme, especially for a first job. Do you not have anything smaller?” 
Kane sighs. “You’re so boring. Fine, listen here. On the outskirts of the town, there’s a mechanic’s shop. Probably has 
tons of scrap and tech you can salvage and use as you please. Or, if you feel like playing Good Samaritan, there’s a 
corporate clinic not far away from there. Should have lots of food and medicine you can distribute to the folks at home.
You won’t have time to hit both, though, you’ll have heat on you as soon as you’re done looting.” 
I nod, “That sounds more like my thing.” 
“Good. So what will it be: a scrap heist or a medicine raid? You decide” 
"""

scrap_heist = """
I go back to the Junkyard and gather my crew. Tai is outside as our getaway as usual, while Anita and I sneak into the 
building. Beth has been undercover for a week now in the Golems scraps factory. She had already knocked out her supervisors
and taken out the power source before we came. We use her card to sneak into the building and begin taking as much scraps
we could carry. This was around 2:00 am and we had to be as quiet as possible. One of the remote Golems security guards 
ran on a separate power source to the building and we’re spotted red handed. Apparently, Beth wasn’t aware of this remote 
Golem in the underground room. I quickly drop all the scraps I was holding and start running to Tai, we had to leave Akima 
and Beth behind without ever knowing what happened to them. 
"""

medicine_raid = """
Kane told us about this chemist store we could go to, apparently the owner is a partner of ours and would be willing to 
help us get some medicine we might need but we need to make it look like a robbery so he won’t be regarded as a suspect. 
After arriving at the place, we talk with the owner and he lets us in. We proceed to take all the supplies we need and 
then as we had planned, we try to make it look like a robbery. I kick some of the trash bins around and throw some of the 
things in the counter on the floor while Tai beats the owner to remove any suspicions from him. As we were about to leave 
the store, we find ourselves surrounded by police Golems, it seems our friend chemist was not so friendly after all and 
he had betrayed us. Our car was just behind them so we ran towards the car kicking the Golems between us and our only 
escape.
"""

method_escape = """
We have managed to secure a good amount of supplies which we can use to improve our conditions at the Junkyard but right 
now we are being followed by a bunch of angry Golems and our car decides to break down in the middle of the runaway. 
Amidst the chaos Tai tells us to calm down and buy him some time as he will patch up the vehicle. Akima on the other hand 
says we should be more realistic and just run away, leaving the supplies behind as our safety should be our main concern. 
I must decide quick.
"""

fix_car = """
We decided to give Tai some time to fix the vehicle, we fought against the Golems for a while and as 
things were getting difficult to handle, Tai finished his repairs and we got away. As we finally arrive at the Junkyard 
I am faced with a tough decision. The Junkyard harbours countless people who, just like me, have nowhere else to go and 
no way of surviving on their own, there are a lot of things that this place needs, we are constantly hiding from the 
government but who’s to say that we won’t have to fight for our lives one day? What if someone finds us and we are forced 
into a war or worse, a massacre. On the other hand, the people here are starving, with no jobs and no way to sustain 
ourselves we have been forced to steal, kill and whatever else was necessary to go on living. Hence my question, should 
I use the scraps to reinforce our security and defences, or should I sell these to buy more food and resources for our 
people?
"""

run_away = """
We decided to run away, fixing the vehicle so quickly seems impossible even for Tai and we can’t hold 
that long against those Golems. We left our scraps behind and ran. However, we didn’t go far, on foot we had no way to 
outrun those Golems and we got captured. This is how our journey ends.
"""

use_scraps = """
I have decided to use the scraps to make improvements around here. We do need food and other resources, 
but I believe with the scraps we have here I could do the improvements in security we need and still have enough spares 
to make some improvements to our food storage, we still have enough resources for now and we can always find a newer source
for those things, meanwhile the defences are something that once upgraded should last for a long time. 
I could be making a huge mistake, but I have decided that worrying about it will only make things worse, everyone in the 
group also agreed so, with the help of Tai, I began making the improvements to our defences and then Akima helped to 
improve our systems security and make it more efficient at detecting threats by using technologies such as artificial 
intelligence and facial recognition, we could detect anyone suspicious. It took a little longer than I expected but we 
managed to finish all the upgrades required so everyone at the Junkyard should be safe for a while now, but our job was 
far from over. We still needed resources to keep everyone alive and well fed, it was time to get access to a steady source 
of income and this is how we forged our plan to kidnap a VIP. Our decision to kidnap a VIP was not an easy one, it would
require us to put ourselves in a lot of risk and we just barely got away from a tricky situation. Regardless, it was a 
job that needed to be done and this was our best option. 
Identifying a target was not an easy task but, with Beth's to help us, we managed to find a governor who is the perfect 
fit to be our target. She infiltrated some important buildings and used her charismatic abilities to get information about 
many of the VIPs, things like their income, their popularity and importance to the government. With this information we 
selected the most disposable governor we could find, someone with a high income but not too many will care if they 
disappear and this is where Akima comes into play, with her extensive knowledge of ethical hacking, she got into the systems 
of the government and managed to get the schedules at which everyone in the main building goes home, she gathered access 
to the door lock systems and managed to lock our target inside the building with only one exit available in the back. 
This was how we split our target from everyone else in the building. Tai drove us behind the building, and I grabbed our 
target and pulled him inside the vehicle. With access to his personal documents, and by threatening him, we managed to 
get ourselves a stable source of income which led the Junkyard to have enough resources for every man woman and child to 
arm themselves in preparation for war.

We’ve got his money, we’ve got his connections, we’ve got his technology, we don’t need him anymore. Beth suggests we 
spare his life that he isn’t useful, Anita says we should kill him that he would be able to ID us and let the corporate 
know about our plans.
"""

sell_scraps = """
We decided to sell the scraps and buy more resources, this should keep us fed for a while. We managed 
to survive that crazy escape and now everyone can eat and drink as much as they want to for a while. Our peace didn’t last 
for long though, without proper security systems in place we were unable to detect a “rat” that infiltrated our precious 
home. Soon, our Junkyard was flooded by the police and other special units, with nowhere to run or hide and no defences 
set we had to give in and were captured by the government.
"""

spare_Oswald = """Tai was insisting to be the one to take him to a particular cell he knew. It was a secret bunker he had
used previously to hideout from the corporate during the early years of their control. On their way their Tai reminded 
Oswald of a woman who previously worked for him as a servant her name was Kimberly and at that moment Oswald turned pale. 
Tai forces him to confess to what he did to her. He confesses that he had her killed after she overheard a conversation 
between Mr Oswald and the current president when they were discussing how to assassinate a certain politician that was 
encouraging the junkyard civilians. Unfortunately for Oswald Kimberly was Tai’s daughter and he had spent years trying 
to find the truth about what happened to her since her disappearance. Immediately after Tai hears this, he shoots Oswald 
in the head and leaves his body in a side walk.
A few hours later when the police were doing their daily patrol they stumbled across his body and secretly started 
investigating his death, because they knew whoever was responsible for his death must have gotten help from an important 
person in the corporate. They then check their records to find out that some parts of the funding given to the police 
department were taking out, and the only person with to that access was Kane. She was questioned and even tortured for 
weeks till she finally caved in and told them everything. They kill her and prepare their troops to wipe out the entirety 
of the Junkyard. 

The news of Kane’s death reaches Elon and his crew and now they know for sure that a war is coming they immediately start 
rounding up their troops and using the resources they took from Oswald and build weapons and armour to defend themselves. 
Every night the men and women slept with their guns and weapons in their hand and were always agitated since they had no 
one on the outside anymore that could tell them exactly when the corporate would attack. 
Three days after Kane’s death, the corporate raids the Junkyard with a Tsar bomb and completely wipes them out with it. 
"""

kill_Oswald = """
We keep him tied up and throw him into the sewers, that way no one would be able to find him. Anita then edited his records 
to make it look like he had made plans to travel out of the country. 
They get back to the junkyard and begin planning their attack, the aim was to make a meticulous plan to that would catch 
the corporate by surprise and take over their government. There are two chances we have to make our move to hit them hard.
In about ten weeks the corporate were having a huge annual feast to celebrate the anniversary of the creation of the first
Golem. Now the issue with this festival is that there would be plenty of security all over the feast to cover ground in 
case they get compromised it will also be a slow battle that would definitely cause a lot of causalities and a lot of chaos. 
However, ten weeks is enough time for the junkyard to make thorough preparations on exactly how to plan the attack and 
it gives us enough time to train our troops properly. The security would also become complacent from all the alcohol and 
partying.
Our other option would have to take place next week. Kane gave us some information about a secret meeting that was about 
to happen among the most elite people in the corporate.  The most important advantage we would have with this mission is 
that there would be less security since not many people know about the meeting and we would easily outnumber them. 
However, we can only attack from one part of the building and they would have the building itself to take cover from while 
we would be out in the open. Our troops would also not be fully prepared for the battle as there is less prep time. The 
security would also be very vigilant because of the importance of the meeting
